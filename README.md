# Generalised Semistructured Model

The documentation related to the GSM model is provided in terms of [JSON Schema](json_schema/GSM.schema.json). From this schema, we can also generate code for the following languages:
 * [Python](json_schema/gsm_python.py), generated through [datamodel-codegen](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator)
 * [Java](json_schema/GSMSchema.java), generated through [jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo)

The full data model and its associated meta-language are described in our latest paper:
